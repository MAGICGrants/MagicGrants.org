title: "MAGIC Firo Fund"
---

The MAGIC Firo Fund was established in December 2022. It is currently administered by the MAGIC Board. It does not have a committee.

The MAGIC Firo Fund is used to further the Firo and associated ecosystem with research projects, educational projects, and more.

The hope is that the Firo community grows large enough to sustain its own committee for this Fund.
