title: "Voter Expectations"

Active and knowledgeable voters are extremely important for the health of a MAGIC Fund!

Voters elect committee members for a MAGIC Fund, and they make other decisions from time to time as requested by MAGIC Grants or the MAGIC Fund.

## Minimum Expectations

In our experience, most voters only need to commit about 5 hours per year to their core duties.

* Vote on the committee and on various occasional decisions (see [how to vote](/funds/voting/)).

* Read the committee member applications.

* Stay up to date and knowledgeable in the Project community.

* Remain polite and professional.

## Extra Credit

Voters ultimately just need to vote. However, voters can improve the significance of their actions by:

* Reaching out to potential donors, encouraging them to donate to the MAGIC Fund.

* Reaching out to potential contractors/employees, encouraging them to apply for grants.

* Reaching out to potential committee candidates, encouraging them to run for the position.

* Reaching out to potential voters, encouraging them to apply to be a voter.

* Running for a committee position themselves.

* Volunteering to support MAGIC Grants's operations.
