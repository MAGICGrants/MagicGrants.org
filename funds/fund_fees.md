MAGIC Grants imposes fees on MAGIC Funds in the following way. MAGIC Grants may make changes to these fees (in its sole discretion) with advance notice including a public feedback period of at least 30 days. Fees may be changed immediately without notice if the changes improve the legal standing of MAGIC Grants.

MAGIC Grants incurs significant costs to manage the investment and grant decisions of MAGIC Fund committees. These fees help MAGIC Grants remain operational.

## Asset Administration Fee

Based on daily average assets; fees per year.

| Daily Average Assets | Asset Administration Fee |
| --- | --- |
| $0 - $1 MM | 0.50% |
| $1 MM - $100 MM | 1.75% |
| $100 MM + | 1.00% |

Example for a Fund with $105 MM in assets every day for a year:
0.5%*(1 MM) + 1.75%*(100 MM - 1 MM) + 1.00% (105 MM - 100 MM) = 0.005 + 1.7325 MM + 0.05 MM = 1.7875 MM

The **minimum annual fee** for any MAGIC Fund (unless specifically waived by the board) is **$5000**. This will be charged at the start of the Fund’s formation and will be charged annually thereafter.

Any fees above the minimum annual fee are levied monthly.
