Active and knowledgeable committee members are extremely important for the health of a MAGIC Fund!

Committee members advise on important MAGIC Fund decisions, including investment and grant decisions.

Though expectations vary by fund, advisory committee members generally are expected to do the following:

* Be an active member in the Project community by following recent news and participating in events.

* Encourage individuals and entities to apply for grants.

* Regularly meet with other committee members to vote on grant proposals and on investment decisions.

* Reach out to community members and organizations to collect donations for the fund.

* Help grow and support the Project community with educational materials.

* Be an upstanding representative for the MAGIC Project Fund.

* Abide by all MAGIC Grants [policies](/about/documentation/).

Committee members should expect to spend several hours a week on their committee duties. We estimate about 150 hours per year is normal. If this is too much, please apply to be a voter instead.
