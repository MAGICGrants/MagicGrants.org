## Why Should I Donate?

At MAGIC Grants, we help to redirect some of the wealth generated in the cryptocurrency world back towards improving the ecosystem. Our goals are simple. With your help, we can make it cheaper to go to college for some folks interested in studying cryptocurrencies. These students need initial support from the cryptocurrency community to know that it is welcoming.

Your donations also support critical infrastructure improvements for public payment networks such as Bitcoin and Monero.
