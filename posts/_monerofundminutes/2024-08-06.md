### Present: Rucknium, kowalabearhugs, artlimber, monerobull

### Proposal from Goodwill Nkosi

We discussed the proposal from Mr. Goodwill Nkosi to implement an energy efficient Monero mining farm and Monero nodes. A decision was made to reply to their email with a request that they formally apply through the form on MoneroFund.org while also respectfully cautioning them that the running of nodes is not a Monero Fund funding priority and unlikely to gain community support.

### Discussion on Marketing/Adoption

We discussed some topics which could lead to future marketing endeavors. This includes reaching out to current cryptocurrency payment processors in an attempt to get them to incorporate Monero and then reaching out and encouraging adoption among merchants closest to the tipping point of accepting cryptocurrency.

Rucknium shared some market surveys on cryptocurrency adoption and merchant sentiment.

### Discussion on Google Ad credits

No ideas were shared regarding the use of the existing MAGIC Google Ad credits.
