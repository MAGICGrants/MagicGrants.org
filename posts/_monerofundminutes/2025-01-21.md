### New grant proposal for 'Tokenized LP - Fund of Funds Monero'

The committee received a grant proposal for, "[Tokenized LP - Fund of Funds Monero](https://github.com/MAGICGrants/Monero-Fund/issues/39)."

After brief discussion four members of the Fund (Rucknium, kayabaNerve, monerobull, and kowalabearhugs) voted to reject this proposal, thus reaching a quorum.

### BTCPay Server Hackathon 

Rucknium broached a discrepancy in committee funding activity and public comments regarding the Monerotopia BTCPay server hackathon.

The committee did vote to fund this proposal however there was no subsequent contact from the proposers regarding quantifiable output from the Monerotopia event, nor has MAGIC Grants approved or provided any disbursement of funds. The latter was confirmed by Justin.
