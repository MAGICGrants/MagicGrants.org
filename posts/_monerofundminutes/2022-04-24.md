### Present: Kayaba, Deverick

### MoneroKon

The MAGIC Monero Fund will have committee members attending MoneroKon and would appreciate having a moment to present MAGIC to the larger community while there. Kayaba, who is certainly planned to go, is already applying to give their own presentation, yet is willing to present another one as well (for 5-15 minutes to quickly state MAGIC on stage). It just may be unfavorable to the organizers to have two presentations by the same person.

### Fundraising

Still managing fundraising ideas, NFTs came up once again as a way to reward users while also raising awareness through automatic community propagation. In order to demonstrate our successes, a quarterly newsletter with updates, such as our in progress grants and their milestones, would also be a reminder which is more meaningful than more generic PR statements.
