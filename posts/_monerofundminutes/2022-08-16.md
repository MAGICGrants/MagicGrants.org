### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, Deverick, Csila, monerobull

### Ethereum Atomic Swaps Awareness

We want to continue to raise awareness for this active fundraiser of ours. Beyond the Monero community, the Ethereum community is a valid audience who will directly benefit from this work, which so far hasn't been engaged with. We also can reach out to multiple sources of Monero community news, ensuring representation there, and it sounds like noot may be featured in an upcoming event.

### Newsletter

Continuing the newsletter discussion, we further discussed sections to include. Beyond our existing grant, and active fundraiser, we discussed our infrastructural improvements and the infrastructure we can use for this newsletter. It was also proposed to include updates on research, highlighting and encouraging our academic side. Finally, methods of reader engagement were discussed.
