### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull

### Grant Request for a Monero Dashboard

We performed temperature checks from the community and didn't hear an outcry of positive support. While we appreciate the opportunity to raise further awareness, there are already a series of Monero dashboards available from the community. We have voted to decline this grant, yet request they reach out in 6 months after having been successfully deployed within other communities so we can re-evaluate value.

### Grant Request for a Centralized Exchange

We have received a grant request to the fund the development of, and liquidity for, a centralized exchange. We performed an initial discussion yet decided to wait until next week when more members are present to vote.
