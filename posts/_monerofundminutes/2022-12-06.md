### Newsletter

With the end of the year approaching, having achieved our prior goal of deplying a site for fundraising, we're revisiting our goal of a newsletter. The same overall goals for it apply, now just with additional items for inclusion.

It would also cut out redundancy, allowing us to review proposals faster. We've named several fields for the chopping block.
