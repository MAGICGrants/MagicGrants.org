### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, Deverick

### MoneroKon

MAGIC is officially on the schedule for MoneroKon, giving a 5 minute lightning talk at 3:45 pm on the first day. This will be presented by Kayaba to briefly establish why MAGIC exists as an alternative to the gathered community.

### Multisig Auditing

As part of MAGIC's commitment to funding audits, the discussed multisig audit is a prime candidate we aim to not only provide funding for, yet hope to also investigate options able to perform the audit. A historical analysis of audits performed via the CCS was done to establish a price of roughly 15,000 USD as what's necessary. Coordination through MAGIC's upcoming donation system was then discussed.

### Grant application finalization

MAGIC is applying to another grant program to increase its funding and the rest of meeting was spent finalizing its application, with notable amounts of commentary on how we embody Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We believe the pseudonomynous process of applying for grants, where the committee can decide without learning identities, and then the charity performing KYC solely to verify legality, perfectly enables a process without discrimination.
