### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull

### Grant Database

We submitted the MAGIC's Monero Fund offer to fund research to a grants database, giving researchers another chance to discover us. This is part of our efforts to reach out to the academic community and find more people willing to contribute to Monero.

### The EABE Attack

Recently, a member of the Monero community expressed interest in research towards defeating the EABE attack. While full chain membership proofs would be one solution, there's been a shortcoming of research to handle it under the decoy privacy model. We agreed it'd be worthwhile to reach out and see if MAGIC can help coordinate/fund this research.
