### ADA Logics fundraiser

The committee agreed to commence further social media marketing efforts in support of the fundraiser.  Matt will get out an email to the MMF subscribers list via the ListMonk instance.
xmrack will continue to direct communications between parties. 

### Cross-platform Haveno App proposal

After some discussion the committee voted to decline this proposal. There is currently a community bounty in place for an [Android App for the Haveno Dex](https://bounties.monero.social/posts/126/37-175m-building-an-open-source-android-app-for-haveno-dex). The committee is prioritizing patience with the progress of the bounty program and the [other developments](https://github.com/atsamd21/Haveno-app) in the Haveno app space. Should there be further evolution in this arena then we will consider revisiting it at a future date. Matt will communicate this to the proposer. 

### Browser wallet discussion

The committee discussed at length the potential for a Monero wallet browser extension citing the popularity of MetaMask and other such wallets as an example. Integration into existing software such as the Brave browser wallet is seen as one immediate avenue. The committee is interested in the potential for further development in this area.
