### Monero <-> Ethereum Atomic Swap Matching

The committee unanimously voted to match donations over the weekend to the active fundraise to further atomic swaps with Ethereum. This was intended to raise awareness and provide a sense of urgency to donating, encouraging donations now instead of allowing parties interested in donating to push it off and forget about it.

### Newsletter and Updates

The content-ready draft of the newsletter was shared, leading to discussions about engagement. We also discussed posting final comments on ACK-J's recently completed work on applying machine learning to Monero transactions.

### Research Contact

Another researcher contact was proposed and will be reached out to. They have contributed work around Monero in the past and we hope to be able to get them to contribute further work in the future.
