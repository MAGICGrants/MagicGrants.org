### Prunability Research

A new paper came out discussing the ability to prune outputs from private blockchains. This is an actively desired topic of research for Monero. We appreciate seeing the field expanded, and candidates for further research on the topic established.

### Overseer Research

We unanimously voted to provide a grant of 13,000 USD, denoted as 86 XMR, to fund research into the Overseer/EAE attacks. Additionally, we will host fundraising for roughly 20,000 USD to complete the research in question.

This work aims to drastically improve our understanding of privacy under the decoy model, premised on a novel application of techniques. We look forward to its findings.
