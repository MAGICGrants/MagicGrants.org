### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull, artlimber, kowalabearhugs

### Email for Paid Promotion

We received an email offering to advertise the MAGIC Monero Fund in exchange for payment. We voted to decline the offer.

### Further Discussion of the Upcoming University Grant

The university replied to Rucknium's comments, giving us a new set of comments to review and evaluate. We primarily discussed both effectiveness of methodoloigy and efficiency of obtaining results.

### Vote on Publicizing the View Key

Due to publicizing the view key potentially reducing the privacy of donors, we did have a vote on if we should publicize it. In the name of transparency, the committee voted in favor of publication, confirming the decision.
