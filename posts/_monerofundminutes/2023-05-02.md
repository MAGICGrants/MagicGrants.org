### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull

### Research Updates

No further updates are available, though we did take time to further discuss active research topics and solicitation for them.

### Molly

Due to the amount of funding Molly is still looking to raise, we unfortunately don't feel MAGIC is likely the best path forward for Molly at this time. We're continuing discussions with them at this time to provide advice and see if there are ways we can still provide assistance.
