### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba

### BCH Donation Address and Donations

Given the community request for one, we have listed a BCH donation address on the MAGIC Monero Fund to ensure the accessibility of funding Monero development, both technological and communal. Recently, we also received a few notable donations, which we look forward to utilizing for these purposes.

### Funding Stability

We discussed pro-actively reaching out to recently shuttered CCS proposals, due to the funding instability, and offering a path forward. While we were unable to provide such a decision at this meeting, we did note we'd want to seek community feedback beforehand. The intent would be to demonstrate MAGIC, while ensuring that previously allocated funds do end up at their designated target, and providing legitimate advantages to Monero despite overall market conditions.

### Researchers

We once again discussed research candidates to reach out, one of them being one of the authors of "Burning Zerocoins for Fun and for Profit", an extremely notable piece of cryptographically-private cryptocurrency history, who has continued to provide research on Monero-related topics.
