### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull

### Proposal from a Microgreens Business

We received a proposal to fund the re-opening of a closed Microgreens store in Lebanon. The proposer notes how the usage of Monero would demonstrate resiliency against the inaccessibility of the traditional financial system in certain regions, and they would intend to accept cryptocurrency (including Monero) within their store.

### Proposal from StakeSpace

StakeSpace submitted a proposal related to DeFi on Monero. They claim they'd offer the ability to perform low-slippage trades and stake directly on Monero. This would involve the deploying of their own token and NFT project as well.
