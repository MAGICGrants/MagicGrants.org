### Re-licensing of work under a grant

We received a request to allow the author of a work, funded by a grant, to change the licensing terms of their work. The grant was issued requiring BSD-3 or CC-BY, as applicable, without mutual agreement. While the committee would not mind MIT/GPL, although they may not be preferable, we are against relicensing under a non-FOSS license (as proposed). We decided to reject this request.
