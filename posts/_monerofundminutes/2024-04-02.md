### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull, kowalabearhugs

### Hackathon at Monerokon

We voted to sponsor a $2000 bounty in the Monerokon hackathon to build something which makes Monero more enjoyable. The vote was unanimous to the present members. Judging will occur by Kayaba, who will be present.

### Grant Updates

We synced on the status of current grants, decided to follow up with one group, and also to request an update be publicly posted by another in order to better show what MAGIC enables.
