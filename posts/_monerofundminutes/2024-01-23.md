### Fundraising of vtnerd

We further organized and prepared for deploying vtnerd's campaign, involving technical discussion and contacts we'll reach out to once the campaign is live.

### Evaluation of the Proposal from a University

We received the final version of a proposal from a university to evaluate in order to better understand the applicability of graph analysis techniques to Monero. We had our discussion on the technicals, and formulated a list of questions we have to respond with.

### Meeting Schedule

We've decided to additionally meet next week to properly manage the active proposals.
