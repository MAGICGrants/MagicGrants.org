### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull, artlimber, kowalabearhugs

### New Committee Member

kowalabearhugs has become a member of the MAGIC Monero Fund, this being their first meeting. Justin Ehrenhofer, president of MAGIC Grants, joined to welcome them, and we brought them up to speed.

### EAE Fundraising Finalizations

The committee paperwork was signed by all members. Rucknium presented the draft for the site, which was reviewed and agreed upon, pending Borggren's approval. We also coordinated a matching Reddit post and discussed other opportunities to raise awareness.
