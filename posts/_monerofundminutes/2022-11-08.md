### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, Deverick, monerobull

### OpenSats Website

We've completed the OpenSats website per our needs and are discussing final deployment steps. This mainly involves ensuring the Docker containers are properly composed, yet also some remaining BTCPay server tasks.

### Update from mj-xmr

We agreed to host fundraising for a grant for mj-xmr. This grant would support the Monero Research Labs, the development of OSPEAD, and work to analyze differences in MyMonero. The fundraising component is currently pending deployment of the new infrastructure. Despite this, mj-xmr has worked on the tasks, providing updates to their tool, `tsqsim`, and analysis of MyMonero's fee behavior. The latter is intended to lead to patches improving users' privacy as part of their continued work.
