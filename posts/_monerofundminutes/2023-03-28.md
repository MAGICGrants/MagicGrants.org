### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull, artlimber

### Grant Request for a Centralized Exchange

We unanimously voted not to fund the creation of a centralized exchange. Not only did we not see sufficient benefit in this specific proposal for a centralized exchange, the role of the MAGIC Monero Fund isn't to entirely fund commercial ventures.

### Research

Rucknium provided brief updates on previously discussed research topics. There is no active involvement warranted on our end at this time.

### Recess

We will not have a meeting next week, by agreeance, due to a lack of necessity and a request by a committee member.
