### Discussion and voting on Statements of Work from the monerod RPC fuzzing solicitation

We discussed the statements of work received from Mayhem Security, Ada Logics, Trails of Bits. 

The committee voted to proceed with the Ada Logics proposal, with some haste. 

The committee aims to hold an open, public fundraiser for this proposal and we will also
reach out to the Power Up Privacy group regarding the funding of this work.
