### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba

This 'meeting' overlapped with Easter and did not have consensus. Because of that, it should not be considered a meeting versus a meetup of members during what would've been the regular meeting.

### Conferences

The MAGIC Monero Fund was able to provide flyers to all individuals who checked in at Monerotopia. Unfortunately, this has failed to convert to any donations. MoneroKon, an upcoming Monero event, may provide a larger opportunity in that we may have the option to speak (either briefly or for a medium period of time) to fully communicate our purpose and captivate attention.

### ACK-J's Machine Learning Grant

ACK-J posted a progress update on his [grant](https://github.com/MAGICGrants/Monero-Fund/issues/15#issuecomment-1086122008), which has met its first milestone and been accordingly paid out. We're very excited to see this working smoothly and look forward to the rest of it.
