### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull, artlimber, kowalabearhugs

### Vote on the University of Zurich's Proposal

We unanimously voted in favor of hosting fundraising for the University of Zurich's proposal.

### Contributions from our Treasury

We also discussed using our limited treasury to fund vtnerd's/the University of Zurich's proposal. We postponed any vote on the matter due to hosting the fundraising alone being unanimously agreeable and because ideally, they do get fundraised. Depending on how their fundraisers go, we may decide to vote on direct funding.
