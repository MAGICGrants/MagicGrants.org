### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, monerobull, artlimber, kowalabearhugs

### Accounting

While our books were prior denominated in the currencies received, the MAGIC Monero Fund is now a USD-denominated fund. If we issue a grant paid in cryptocurrency, we are still able to perform payment in cryptocurrency, and still will reserve part of our treasury in the necessary cryptocurrency to ensure our ability to fulfill the grant. Outside of grant-allocated cryptocurrency, we no longer have cryptocurrency holdings.

This change was enacted by the MAGIC Board due to the burden presented by managing a multi-currency treasury.

### Updated Community Post

We are planning a new post to the community to provide an update on our efforts and work done so far.
