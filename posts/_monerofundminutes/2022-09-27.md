### BTCPay

After our previous fundraise, we've had a lot of discussion about simplifying the donation process. The community has an adverse reaction to our usage of Gofundme for tracking donations, along with handling fiat donations. Obtaining a Monero address, or another supported cryptocurrency address, is also obfuscated. This leaves two goals.

1) Immediately stating cryptocurrency donation addresses on announcement posts
2) Placing a trackable counter on the announcement post

This will also reduce the amount of labor required by increasing our automation. While we've previously discussed a solution by a community member, and have historically discussed building our own solution, we believe BTCPay will be a standing solution usable for our purposes. Not only is it designed to track deposits, it can also provide a tally over simple HTTP requests, making it highly integrateable. The immediate focus will be on setting this up.

### Monero Documentation RFP

Hearing community requests for greater documentation, we are considering placing a call for proposals to attract writers to provide said documentation. This would greatly help parties integrate, and therefore adopt, Monero. A list of potentially relevant developers has also been started.
