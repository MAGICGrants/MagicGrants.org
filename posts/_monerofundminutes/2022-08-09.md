### Present: Rucknium, Kayaba, Deverick, Csila, monerobull

### Election Results

monerobull was elected to the MAGIC Monero Fund Committee, becoming our fifth member. The parallel election regarding who should complete the two-year term which was vacant, either the newly elected member or the original election's third choice, promoted Kayaba to the two-year term.

### Newsletter

The MAGIC Monero Fund is planning a quarterly newsletter to present our work and continue to raise awareness of our upcoming projects. We hope to be able to present a rough draft at our next meeting which can be worked into our first issue. The potential to have another party operate our newsletter discussed, which would reduce the committee's workload while potentially yielding a higher quality product to a larger audience. Despite a few angles being discussed, one amicable to all parties which puts the Fund's interests first didn't appear.

### Advertising

Continuing the previous discussion, reaching out to various community newsletters to announce pieces of Monero Fund news, such as the upcoming Ethereum Atomic Swaps fundraise, would be very beneficial. While we already ensure items are discussed on Reddit and so on, awareness seems to be our biggest issue and inclusion on more platforms would be effective at solving that.
