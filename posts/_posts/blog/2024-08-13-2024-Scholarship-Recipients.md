We are excited to announce our 2024 MAGIC Grants Scholarship recipients! All three recipients this year agreed to be named publicly. This is not a condition to receive the award, and it does not impact one's application in any way.

These students will receive $2000:

* Lily Chen - Massachusetts Institute of Technology Senior

* Javier Leon Martinez - George Mason University Senior

* Sourish Vankadari - Rutgers Universityâ€“New Brunswick Sophomore

We want to thank these recipients for their cryptocurrency ambitions so far, and we hope that they will continue to make the ecosystem a better place!

We also want to thank all of the applicants this year! Over 400 students applied, a new record!
