MAGIC Grants is pleased that [the campaign](https://magicgrants.org/Firo-Lelantus-Spark-Audit/) to raise funds for a Lelantus Spark code audit was successful! The Firo community generously donated ~$28,708 through our [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/code-audit-for-lelantus-spark-in-firo). The remaining amount necessary for the audit was provided by the Firo Community Fund (FCF).

MAGIC Grants is holding the $80,000 in total donations in USD. This removes volatility risks, which is important for donors and contractors. The [initial HashCloak proposal](https://funding.firo.org/proposals/lelantus-spark-code-audit-proposal-by-hashcloak-mikerahq) on the Firo Crowdfunding System added 10% as a volatility buffer. Since this is no longer necessary, we can save donors $8,000, while also reducing risks for the auditors!

This campaign was supported by 30 individual donors and the FCF. We especially would like to thank [Rasikh Morani](https://twitter.com/RasikhMorani) and [The Arcadia Group](https://twitter.com/TheArcadiaGroup) for their substantial contributions. The FCF donated $52,073.39.

Donations to MAGIC Grants are tax deductible to the extent allowable by law. Please [email us](mailto:info@magicgrants.org) if you would like to make a donation!

We would like to thank the Firo community and HashCloak for trusting MAGIC Grants to simplify the audit experience!
