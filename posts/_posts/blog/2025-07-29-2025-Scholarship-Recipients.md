We are excited to announce our 2025 MAGIC Grants Scholarship recipients! All three recipients this year agreed to be named publicly. This is not a condition to receive the award, and it does not impact one's application in any way.

These students will receive $2000:

* Udit Kastwar - KIET Group of Institutions Sophomore

* Rifah Maulidya - Indiana University Bloomington Freshman

* Mateo Pati√±o - Columbia University Freshman

We want to thank these recipients for their cryptocurrency ambitions so far, and we hope that they will continue to make the ecosystem a better place!

We also want to thank all the applicants this year!
