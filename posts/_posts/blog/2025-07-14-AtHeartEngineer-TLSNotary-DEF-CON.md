We're excited to share that MAGIC Grants board member AtHeartEngineer, who [joined the board](https://magicgrants.org/2024/10/08/Adding-atheartengineer-As-Board-Member) last year, will be leading a hands-on workshop at DEF CON 33! We're proud to see our board members contribute to the cybersecurity community.

AtHeartEngineer will present "Provably exfiltrating data by breaking TLS in the right ways." This workshop is scheduled for Sunday at 9:00 AM in the LVCC - L2 - Workshops area and will run for 240 minutes.

This workshop will cover multi-party TLS (not man-in-the-middle), teaching attendees how to prove and verify online data authenticity to a third-party while preserving privacy. The session will start with small examples and build towards custom plugins for proving and verifying private user data.

AtHeartEngineer brings extensive experience, having previously led engineering at Privacy and Scaling Explorations, a non-profit focused on privacy-preserving technologies using programmable cryptography tools like zero-knowledge proofs.

This is a great opportunity to gain practical skills in a cutting-edge area of cryptography. If you're at DEF CON 33, bring your laptop and learn how to unlock and compose web data in new ways!
