## MAGIC Grants Approves Security Retainer with HashCloak

We are pleased to announce that the MAGIC Board has approved a security retainer with [HashCloak](https://hashcloak.com/) for [Firo](https://firo.org/) that will utilise the [MAGIC Firo Fund](https://magicgrants.org/funds/). 

The security retainer focuses on building out Firo’s fuzz testing infrastructure, expanding unit test coverage, and augmenting Firo’s existing PR review process. Additionally, the retainer also ensures Firo is abreast of the latest vulnerabilities and security techniques along with assessing vulnerabilities in other chains and their applicability to Firo.

Fuzz testing uses the same tools that threat actors use to find exploits and helps to find bugs and vulnerabilities that are not covered by unit tests or even manual audits. Firo’s fuzz testing infrastructure will be extended and built out especially those concerning [Lelantus Spark](https://firo.org/2021/08/24/presenting-lelantus-spark.html), which is expected to go live on mainnet later this year. Once set-up it can run for as long as required in the background and extended to cover new code.

HashCloak will also examine Firo’s existing unit test coverage and extend them beyond the standard ones covering newer test cases and edge cases. 

As part of the security retainer, Hashcloak will also augment Firo’s existing review process, especially those that touch critical parts of Firo’s codebase. This will add fresh and unbiased eyes to PR reviews.
