The new website [GetMonero.dev](https://getmonero.dev) now serves unofficial Monero developer and user documentation.

It has been forked from MoneroDocs.org, which unfortunately no longer serves content.

The previous content has been preserved, and [GetMonero.dev](https://getmonero.dev) is accepting new contributors:

[https://github.com/MAGICGrants/getmonero.dev](https://github.com/MAGICGrants/getmonero.dev)

Contributing is easy! Simply make markdown files in this folder:

[https://github.com/MAGICGrants/getmonero.dev/tree/master/docs](https://github.com/MAGICGrants/getmonero.dev/tree/master/docs)

Then, open a pull request. When merged, the changes will be deployed to the universe.

Please help us improve Monero developer and user documentation. Thanks!

Thank you to serhack for the domain.
