The MAGIC Monero Fund is pleased to announce that it is now accepting applications for research grants focused on improving the Monero protocol and ecosystem. The application process is [described here](https://github.com/MAGICGrants/Monero-Fund/blob/main/Research-Grant-RFP.md).  

The committee will evaluate grant applications based on:

* Impact on Monero's privacy, scaling, decentralization, and/or user experience
    
* Feasibility of research plan
    
* Prior work and qualifications of applicant(s)
    
* Clear plan to integrate research findings into Monero's protocol and/or ecosystem
    
Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. The MAGIC Monero Fund anticipates funding requests of the equivalent of 5,000 to 20,000 USD at this time. Note that recipients of grants will have to submit identity information to MAGIC Grants as part of compliance with U.S. Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.

The inaugural MAGIC Monero Fund committee was elected by Monero community members in January 2022. Committee meeting minutes are available for public viewing [here](https://magicgrants.org/funds/monero/).
