MAGIC Grants is extremely excited to announce a generous donation from [Arcadia](https://arcadia.agency)! Their $200,000 tax-deductible donation will go towards Firo ecosystem improvements, including research, development, security reviews, educational materials, and more.

MAGIC Grants is communicating with Reuben Yap and Rasikh Morani to create an action plan for these funds to be put to best use. One option on the table is the creation of a MAGIC Firo Fund with its own steering committee.

Firo is a decentralized cryptocurrency network with advanced privacy features. Their Lelantus Spark code audit was [recently completed](https://firo.org/2022/12/20/lelantus-spark-code-audit-completed.html) with the [help](https://magicgrants.org/MAGIC-Grants-Saves-Firo-Community-8000-Lelantus-Spark-Audit/) of MAGIC Grants. Lelantus Spark is based on open research, and the code is MIT-licensed for anyone to use.

This donation allows the Firo community to pursue a variety of important ecosystem projects. MAGIC Grants is happy to support projects that advance its charitable goals.

As a nonprofit with 501(c)(3) public charity status, donations to MAGIC Grants in cash or cryptocurrencies are tax deductible to the extent allowable by law. If you would like to make a donation before the end of this tax year, please email us at [info@magicgrants.org](mailto:info@magicgrants.org). You can optionally choose to allocate your donation towards a specific initiative, such as our scholarship program, the MAGIC Monero Fund, or the Firo ecosystem.

Happy holidays!
