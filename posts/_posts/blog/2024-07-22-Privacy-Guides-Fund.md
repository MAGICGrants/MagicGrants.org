The MAGIC Grants board is *extremely* excited to announce our new [MAGIC Privacy Guides Fund](/funds/privacy_guides).

[Privacy Guides](https://privacyguides.org) is the leading resource for privacy recommendations and privacy-focused educational content. Their websites [receive upwards of 1.5 million page views per month as of June 2024](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/about/statistics/).

Privacy Guides is trusted due to the excellent efforts of its maintainers. They have strict policies against ads and referral links, and all recommendations are [open-source](https://github.com/privacyguides) and subject to public scrutiny.

Privacy Guides [hosts an active forum](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/) for community discussions on recent privacy news. The MAGIC Grants board is impressed with the quality of the discussions that are held there, as well as the effective moderation standards.

The MAGIC Board is proud to host the Privacy Guides project under the MAGIC Privacy Guides Fund. All five original maintainers of the Privacy Guides project are now members of the MAGIC Privacy Guides Fund committee.

## Benefits to Privacy Guides

By nestling Privacy Guides under a MAGIC Privacy Guides Fund, the Privacy Guides project is able to operate as a part of a 501(c)(3) public charity while keeping their administration overhead as light as possible. Should Privacy Guides grow large enough to warrant their own organization, the committee can vote to encourage the MAGIC Board to transfer the Privacy Guides project to a qualifying organization. This multi-layered approach allows the project maintainers to focus on our shared core mission: to make educational materials.
