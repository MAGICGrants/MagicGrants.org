The [MAGIC Monero Fund](/funds/monero) donated â‚¬2,000 in XMR to the [Monero Konferenco](https://monerokon.org) to support their [2024 hackathon](https://monerokon.devfolio.co/). This donation allowed the MAGIC Monero Fund to select a submission to receive the "Enhancement to XMR Usability Award".

The [winning submission](https://github.com/dllud/fast-sync-pitch) from [jomuel](https://github.com/jomuel) and [dllud](https://github.com/dllud/) [implemented fast sync](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate/pull/155) in Cuprate. [Cuprate](https://github.com/Cuprate/cuprate) is an open-source alternative Monero node implementation in Rust.

According to the authors, fast sync reduces initial Cuprate sync time from 15 days to 4 days.

Alternative implementations of node software help make decentralized systems more robust and secure. MAGIC Grants is excited to further its charitable mission to maintain public infrastructure by making it easier for users to operate the most essential piece of this infrastructure: nodes.
