## Special Election for the MAGIC Monero Fund

On June 21, 2022, Vik Sharma voluntarily resigned from the MAGIC Monero Fund due to a lack of time. The MAGIC Grants board and the MAGIC Monero Fund committee would like to thank Vik for his service to the committee and to the Monero community.

**We are looking for new MAGIC Monero Fund committee candidates and MAGIC Monero Fund voters for this special election.**

As described in the [Monero Fund document](/funds/monero/monero_fund): 

> MAGIC Fund Committee resignations or removals will initiate a special election, for which the newly-elected member will serve the remainder of the resigning or removed memberâ€™s term.

Vik's term was initially supposed to last two years, ending in January 2024.

In this special election, we are asking two questions:

1. Who should replace Vik as a committee member? Candidates are invited to apply by July 20th.

2. Should 1) the new committee member serve the remainder of the two year term (ending in January 2024), or 2) the new committee member serve the remainder of a one year term (ending in January 2023), and have the third-ranked MAGIC Monero Fund candidate from the initial election kayabaNerve promoted to a longer term ending in January 2024.

Normally, terms are for two years. However, only the two most-voted for members of the inaugural committee were afforded two year terms, with the other three afforded one year terms.

The MAGIC Grants board believes that it's important to maintain a staggered election cycle so that not every member is a part of each election.
