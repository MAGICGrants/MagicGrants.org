MAGIC Grants is raising funds for the Firo community to be able to audit the Lelantus Spark code that is expected to be used in [Firo](https://firo.org). View [the campaign here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/code-audit-for-lelantus-spark-in-firo).

**Firo donation address: aBnDCFrR3v7j8nH4HHAtyXazZcKVo6iH9k**
*Please email [info@magicgrants.org](mailto:info@magicgrants.org) after making your donation.*
 
Lelantus Spark is a proving system that is quite promising for use in Firo, Monero, and other public, permissionless payment infrastructure.
 
The Firo team has already coordinated audits of the proving system. In this case, MAGIC Grants is assisting with an audit of the actual code implementation.
 
The specific audit firms have not yet been selected. Reuben Yap from the Firo community has advised that MAGIC Grants should open this fundraising campaign in advance of audit proposals to expedite the process. The fundraising campaign will be adjusted to the real amount when known.
 
This project funding proposal includes:

* An audit by a capable firm for the Firo code implementation of Lelantus Spark.
* This audit report will be made public.
 
This campaign is necessary to support the security of an public, permissionless payment network. 

MAGIC Grants accepts donations [through GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/code-audit-for-lelantus-spark-in-firo) with credit/debit cards. If you prefer to make a donation outside of GoFundMe (for example, an "offline" donation with Firo or another cryptocurrency), please [click here](/contribute/). Your donation will still count towards the proposal, but it will need to be added manually to this page after a delay.
 
**Your donation is tax-deductible** to the amount allowable by law. In 2021, you may be able to take a **$300 (for individuals) or $600 (for married filing jointly) above-the-line tax deduction** *even if you do not itemize your deductions*. Take advantage of the [tax benefits](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/expanded-tax-benefits-help-individuals-and-businesses-give-to-charity-during-2021-deductions-up-to-600-available-for-cash-donations-by-non-itemizers) afforded to you and support a cause you care about!
  
MAGIC Grants is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on expanding education and research in cryptocurrencies, and for supporting public, permissionless payment infrastructure. MAGIC Grants distributed $6,000 this 2021-2022 school year in scholarships to students interested in cryptocurrencies.
 
In the unlikely case that the project is not fully funded and we are unable to begin the project, or if the project is canceled for any reason, MAGIC Grants will treat the donations as unrestricted donations. If there is a funding excess, MAGIC Grants will treat the excess as unrestricted donations. MAGIC Grants will use the funds for any other appropriate purpose, which could be another payment infrastructure proposal or a scholarship, among other things within its mission. MAGIC Grants will intend to spend the funds on a Firo-related project.
