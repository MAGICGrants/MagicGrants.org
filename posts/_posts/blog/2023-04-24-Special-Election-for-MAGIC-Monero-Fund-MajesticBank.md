The MAGIC Grants board has decided to remove MajesticBank from the MAGIC Monero Fund due to inactivity. They attended the first committee meeting, but they have not attended of the weekly committee meetings since. The board decided that it was best to remove this inactive committee member, and to hold a special election to fill the vacant seat.

**We are looking for new MAGIC Monero Fund committee candidates for this special election.**

MajesticBank's term was initially supposed to last two years, ending in January 2025. The elected committee member will serve the remainder of this term.
